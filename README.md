The researcher conducted an analysis on the influence of ad placement on the Click-Through Rates (CTR) on a highly popular news site. The collected data over a ten-day period documented the CTR for an advertisement of a sports shoe brand, “ZoomRunners,” placed in three different locations on the site: the left sidebar, within the content (center), and the right sidebar.

Each day during the observation period, the Click-Through Rate (CTR) was recorded for each advertisement placement location, forming a dataset reflecting the user response variations throughout the study period. In this context, the CTR is calculated as the number of clicks per one hundred views, providing an indication of how effectively the advertisements attract user attention and prompt responsive actions.

This specific dataset records the daily Click-Through Rates (CTR) for each advertisement placement location: left, center, and right positions on the website. For instance, on “Day 1,” the CTR was 2.5 for the left placement, 3.8 for the center placement, and 3.1 for the right placement. This pattern was analyzed over a ten-day observation period.
